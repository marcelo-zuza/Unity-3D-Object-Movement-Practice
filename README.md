# Unity 3D Object Movement Practice

This project is a simple Unity 3D game that demonstrates the movement of a 3D object within a specified range. The goal is to provide a starting point for practicing and experimenting with 3D object movement in Unity.

## Project Description

The provided code snippet is a part of a larger Unity 3D project. The `ObjectMover` script is responsible for moving a 3D object (e.g., a cube, sphere, or any other 3D model) along a specified path. The object can move in a linear or circular pattern, and the movement can be controlled by adjusting speed, direction, and other parameters.

## Features

- Customizable 3D object movement patterns (linear, circular).
- Adjustable movement speed, direction, and rotation.
- Customizable movement path (e.g., straight line, curve, spiral).
- Optional randomization of movement parameters.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Install Unity 3D (version 2019.4.21f1 or later recommended).
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open the project in Unity.
4. Open the `SampleScene` located in the `Assets/Scenes` folder.
5. Press the play button in the Unity editor to run the game.

## Scripts

The main script used in this project is `ObjectMover`. It is located in the `Assets/Scripts` folder.

## Assets Used

The provided code snippet does not include any specific assets. However, you can use any 3D model you want by adding it to the scene and attaching the `ObjectMover` script to the model.
